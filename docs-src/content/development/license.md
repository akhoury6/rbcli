## How Rbcli is Licensed

We want to help the developer community build tooling faster and with less work. That's why Rbcli was built. And let's face it - most of us aren't lawyers, and don't want to worry about legal fine print when building awesome software. That's why Rbcli is released under the __MIT License__. So you're free to use Rbcli as you see fit to write your software.
