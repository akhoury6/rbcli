# How RBCli is Licensed

We want to help the developer community build tooling faster and with less work. That's why RBCli was built. And let's face it - most of us aren't lawyers, and don't want to worry about legal fine print when building awesome software. That's why RBCli is released under the __GPLv3 License__. So you're free to use RBCli as you see fit to write free software. If you wish to use RBCli in a commercial offering, please contact me at [andrew@bluenex.us](mailto: andrew@bluenex.us).
