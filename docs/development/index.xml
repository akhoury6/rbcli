      <description>Contributing to RBCli is the same as most open source projects:&#xA;Fork the repository Create your own branch Submit a pull request when ready That&amp;rsquo;s all there is to it! We&amp;rsquo;ve also kept our acceptance criteria pretty simple, as you&amp;rsquo;ll see below. Feel free to submit a pull request even if you don&amp;rsquo;t meet it if you would like your code or feature to be reviewed first; we do want to be mindful of your time and will review submissions before they are polished.</description>

      <description>How RBCli is Licensed We want to help the developer community build tooling faster and with less work. That&amp;rsquo;s why RBCli was built. And let&amp;rsquo;s face it - most of us aren&amp;rsquo;t lawyers, and don&amp;rsquo;t want to worry about legal fine print when building awesome software. That&amp;rsquo;s why RBCli is released under the GPLv3 License. So you&amp;rsquo;re free to use RBCli as you see fit to write free software. If you wish to use RBCli in a commercial offering, please contact me at andrew@blacknex.</description>
