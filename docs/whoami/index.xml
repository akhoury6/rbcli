    <title>My Letter To You :: Rbcli Documentation</title>
    <link>https://akhoury6.github.io/rbcli/whoami/index.html</link>
    <description>My Fellow Coder,&#xA;I’m glad to see you are interested in Rbcli. I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Andrew, and I’ve been a technologist since 1992 when my father bought our first family computer – a 486DX2 which ran at 66Mhz (33Mhz if you turned off the ’turbo’ button) and came with MS DOS 5.0, QBasic, and a game already coded in it called Nibbles (if you care to see the code, die 5 times and don’t play again).</description>
