  ##### Hooks (Optional) #####
  # These hooks are scheduled on the Rbcli execution engine to run
  # Pre- and Post- the command specified. They are executed after
  # everything else has been initialized, so the runtime configuration
  # values are all made available, as they will appear to the command.
  #
  # These are good for parsing and/or doing transformations on the provided
  # configuration before passing them to the command, and for cleaning
  # up your environment afterwards.
