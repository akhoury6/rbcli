# <%= @vars[:cmdname] %>

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem.

You'll find your gem's Command Line entrypoint under the file `exe/<%= @vars[:cmdname] %>`, although you shouldn't need to edit this file. Instead, follow these steps to get up and running quickly:

* Review the configuration under the `config` directory
* Modify global CLI options under the `application/options.rb` file
* Generate a new command by running `rbcli generate -t command -n <name>`
* Modify the command's code under `application/commands/<name>.rb`
* Repeat the previous two steps until complete!

For more details, including advanced usage, please see the [RBCli documentation](https://github.com/akhoury6/rbcli). 

TODO: Delete the text above and write your README!
